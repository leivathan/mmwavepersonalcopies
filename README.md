These are my personal copies of the code I worked on while in Tony Wong's research group at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign from Summer 2020 to Summer 2021.
The purpose of this code was to work on graphing star-formation data of distant galaxies in heatmaps. I was in charge of creating the graphing programs and adding features as needed such as normalization controls, masking, and general colormap controls.
